1)  first try:
        super_resolution_num_res_blocks = 10
        batch_size = 100
        steps_per_epoch = 1500
        num_epochs = 3
        patch_size = 32
        num_channels = 50

        visual results: poor...
        validation loss: 0.0043

2) second try: more epochs - checking if it will significantly improve the visual results?
        super_resolution_num_res_blocks = 10
        batch_size = 100
        steps_per_epoch = 1500
        num_epochs = 10
        patch_size = 32
        num_channels = 50

        visual results: nice!
        validation loss: 0.0034

3)  third try: less steps per epoch - it will take less time but will it defect the visual results significantly?
        super_resolution_num_res_blocks = 10
        batch_size = 100
        steps_per_epoch = 100
        num_epochs = 10
        patch_size = 32
        num_channels = 50

        visual results: visually looks pretty much like the second try
        validation loss: 0.0039
